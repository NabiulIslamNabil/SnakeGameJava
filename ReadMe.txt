This is a snake game made with Java. I used the basic Swing class
of java in order to make this game. By using the arrow key, you can 
move the snake up down left and right. By consuming each food, you
get 10 points. If the head of the snake touches it's body or if the 
head of snake touches the endpoints of the panels, GAME IS OVER.
ENJOY THE GAME and feel free to suggest some improvements.
